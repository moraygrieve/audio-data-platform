Useful Notes
============

SSL and HTTPS notes
-------------------
Note that we really want to get a verified certificate, but short term we can
use an unsigned certificate. To generate the java keystore use the below;

$ keytool -genkeypair -alias blade -keyalg RSA -keystore blade.jks /
      -dname "CN=localhost,OU=AA,O=AA,L=Cambridge,ST=Cambs,C=UK"

To then generate a .pem public key that can be used client side use the below;

$ keytool -exportcert -alias blade -keystore blade.jks -rfc -file blade.pem


At the moment we bundle the keystore in the blade archive; ideally we would securely
put on the ec2 instances.


DynamoDB
--------
For some transactional support see https://github.com/awslabs/dynamodb-transactions.


Python Client
-------------
Using Python for client side interaction we use the requests library (sudo pip install requests).
To enable certificate verification see https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide.html#ssl.
Because we are not using a verified certificate we point the requests module to the public .pem
key of the keystore.

There a some scripts in the src/main/python/ directory as examples of using the server REST API.
